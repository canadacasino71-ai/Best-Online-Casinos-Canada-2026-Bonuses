## 🔬 Our Audit Methodology: How We Review

To ensure **Expertise** and **Experience**, every review on CasinosInCanada.com undergoes a rigorous 5-stage audit:

### 1. Licensing & Security Check
We verify active licenses from **iGaming Ontario (iGO)**, **Kahnawake Gaming Commission**, MGA, or Curacao. We also check for valid SSL encryption and KYC/AML protocols.

### 2. The "Real Money" Payout Test
We do not rely on stated processing times. Our testers make real deposits and withdrawals using **Interac e-Transfer**, **Bitcoin**, and **Credit Cards** to log the exact time until funds reach the account.

### 3. RTP & Fairness Verification
We inspect the source code of slots to ensure casinos are not using "lowered RTP" versions of popular games. We compare published RTP against actual game logs.

### 4. Terms & Conditions Analysis
Our legal experts scan T&Cs for predatory clauses, such as hidden max cashouts or impossible wagering requirements on bonuses.
